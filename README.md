# sketch-rnn

Please see My_Sketch_RNN.ipynb for the code and commentary for this project. 

Checkpoint, model_config.json, and omniglot.npz are needed to run this code in Google Colab. They should be uploaded to the content file within the notebook.

The other files -- data_tool.js, basic_predict.js, basic_predict.html, and raw_data.js (which is a compacted version of my model’s weights)--are part of my attempt to build an interactive web demo using my model (which unfortunately isn’t working).
